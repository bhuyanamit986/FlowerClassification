# FlowerClassification

# Introduction

---

Here I have taken a flower classification dataset from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html. After some preprocessing of images I took InceptionNet as my model and fine tuned it's last 50 layers and freezed all the first 50 but batch normalization layers.
